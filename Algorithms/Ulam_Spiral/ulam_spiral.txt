In 1963, during the presentation of, as he put it, a “long and very boring paper” at a scientific meeting, mathematician Stanislaw Ulam began doodling. He wrote out numbers in a square spiral pattern, and then highlighted the prime numbers.
Prime numbers are the whole numbers that are only evenly divisible by 1 and themselves. 17 is a prime, because it can only be evenly divided by 1 or 17. 8 is not prime, since in addition to 1 and 8 it can also be evenly divided by 2 and 4. The Greek mathematician Euclid proved that there are an infinite number of primes in 300 BCE. But across thousands of years, mathematicians have been unable to come up with a formula for predicting which numbers will be prime or composite (that is, not prime). Many questions about prime numbers remain to this day.
But there have been several tantalizing clues. Ulam noticed that his spiral marked primes as often fell along diagonal, vertical, and horizontal lines. But it is still impossible to precisely predict where a prime will appear.
This program recreates a verison visualization of the Ulam Spiral that Ulam created on the MANIAC II computer at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory with Myron Stein and Mark Wells. The blue dots mark composite (that is, not prime) numbers, with the size of the dot related to how many divisors the composite number has.
